# TISC-2023

## Overview

Welcome to my brief documentation for attempts at The InfoSecurity Challenge (TISC) in 2023. It focuses on my thought processes, strategy and solutions for the challenges.

TISC, short for "The InfoSecurity Challenge" by CSIT (Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies), is a sequential Capture-The-Flag competition featuring 10 levels. Solving each level unlocks the next, with higher levels becoming increasingly difficult.

## Approach

My approach to the challenges was to:

* Have a simple "go-for-the-lowest-hanging-fruit" mindset.
  
* Fearlessly explore and delve into rabbit holes, as every exploration is an opportunity to learn, which is the essence of a CTF anyway. :wink:

* Take breaks, retrace my steps and challenge the assumptions made at each stage.

* And of course, try harder. :trollface:

## Strategy:

My strategy was to:

1. Read through the descriptions and try to pick up little hints to get a sense of the challenge direction.

2. Examine the downloaded files (if there are) and the tools often used in the category.

3. Break down the current challenge to smaller issues to solve.

4. Take it step-by-step and solve one issue at a time.

5. Document (with a lot of screenshots) as I go, so that I can retrace my steps later.

## Challenges Faced

A lot of time on reading was needed to make sure I at least knew the pre-requisites to a topic and understand how to approach it. But this only pushed me further in to explore more about the same topics.

## Conclusion and Acknowledgments

Participating in TISC 2023 was an incredible learning experience. Despite juggling this along with other projects, I learnt a lot and managed to hone my approach and strategy. I would like to thank my friends for their support throughout the competition.
